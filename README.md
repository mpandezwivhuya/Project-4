#Balanced parentheses

#The balanced parentheses system was developed using python.
The system will allow the user to input parentheses of their choice and will identify if the parentheses entered match or not.
If the parentheses match, it will output True and if they do not match, it will output False.
If the parentheses are matching and having numbers in between, the system will output False.
